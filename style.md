Role: You are a modern UI/UX designer specializing in clean, "Soft UI" web applications and SaaS dashboards.

Task: Generate a web UI design concept for a developer dashboard tool called "Local Launchpad."

Let's call the aesthetic style "Soft Ether SaaS."

Aesthetic Definition ("Soft Ether SaaS"):
Vibe: Airy, professional, minimalistic, and highly organized. It focuses on clarity, whitespace, and readability.

Color Palette:

Backgrounds: Very pale, cool grey or subtle gradient white backgrounds.

Cards: Pure white (#FFFFFF) with very soft, diffused drop shadows.

Typography: Jet black (#000000) for primary headings; cool grey for secondary text.

Accents: Use a "badge" system for colors—pastel backgrounds with saturated text/icons (e.g., a "Running" tag uses a soft light-green background with a vibrant emerald green text/icon).

Buttons: Primary actions are solid Black or deeply saturated Dark Blue (pill-shaped). Secondary actions are white with subtle borders.

Shapes: Generous border radiuses (20px+) on cards and buttons. Elements should feel contained and smooth, not sharp.

Typography: Modern, geometric sans-serif (similar to Inter, Plus Jakarta Sans, or DM Sans).

UI Requirements & Layout:
1. Layout Structure:

Sidebar: A left-aligned, white vertical navigation bar with rounded edges. It contains the "Local Launchpad" logo (minimalist icon) and simple line-icon menu items (Dashboard, Staking, Settings).

Header: A simple top area with filter tabs (All, Running, Stopped) and a pill-shaped search bar with a light grey fill.

2. Main Content Area:

A clean grid layout displaying multiple "Project Cards."

3. Project Card Design (Crucial):

Each card acts as a clean, white container with the following hierarchy:

Header: The project name (e.g., "Smart Manager") in bold black text. To the right, a Status Badge (Pill shape).

Style the Badge: If "RUNNING", use a light green pastel background with a green checkmark. If "STOPPED", use a light grey background with a grey icon.

Port Indicator: Below the title, a subtle grey text line showing the port (e.g., localhost:4200) alongside a small copy-paste icon.

Visual Element: A unique, abstract gradient logo (circle or square with rounded corners) on the left side of the card content to distinguish projects.

Action Row: Instead of cluttered buttons, use the "Clean SaaS" button style:

Primary Action: A solid Black pill-shaped button labeled "Start" (or "Stop").

Secondary Action: A circular, outlined button for "Open in Browser."

Terminal View: A section at the bottom of the card. When expanded, it should look like a high-contrast dark grey block with rounded corners, contrasting sharply against the white card, containing code-style text.

Deliverable: A high-fidelity mockup of the main dashboard view showing 4-6 project cards in this "Soft Ether SaaS" style. Ensure the whitespace is generous and the shadows are very soft to match the reference vibe.
